The way that this challenge is solved is by chaining together selectors. In this case, you put the parent class of text next to the id class of text-main, this makes the selector more specific. How I solved the challenged was by adding another id on top of the current id and adding !important to the color.  This worked but was not the best way to solve it.  Seeing how the instructor did it was extremely helpful in understanding how to finish this challenge.
